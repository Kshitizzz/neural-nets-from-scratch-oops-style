# neural-nets-from-scratch-oops-style
 In the pursuit of learning Object Oriented programming, neural-nets and git, here I will try to implemet a neural net from scratch using numpy only, in object-oriented style.  

Note that, I am following Sentdex's Series on YouTube, I have written this code, but I have referenced it from his videos. All due credits to: Harrison Kinsley (Harrison@pythonprogramming.net)

I will update the code as I progress through my learning journey. Taking baby steps at a time.

Hopefully this exercise will give me some hands-on practise with OOPs, git and neural nets. Feel free to use any of the code here.

Cheers!
